Abstract
Road accident leads to more than 38,000 deaths every year in crashes on U.S. roadways and an additional 4.4 million injured seriously enough to require medical attention. Economic and societal impact of road crashes costs U.S. approximately $871 billion/year[7].

This project examines accidents occurring across US, over a 4 year period, through a detailed study of features associated with each. Our group followed a multi-phased approach to identify key factors linked to the accidents, both at an overall Country level and within one key State. The goal of the project is to outline key parameters causing accidents within a State as well as to propose potential accident mitigation strategies to policy makers and authorized personnel of respective departments (DoT, DMV etc.).

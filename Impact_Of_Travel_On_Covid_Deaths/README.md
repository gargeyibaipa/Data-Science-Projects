## **Conclusion & Insights**

We performed detailed analysis of two key datasets: one with information on number of people staying at home vs on the move, while the other providing number of Covid related deaths by date. Both datasets centered around different counties across states in USA. The reason for our selection of these two datasets was mainly to assess the impact of spread of Covid on people's mobility and monitor any trends as duration of the pandemic increases and extends to last quarter of 2020. Following key insights were inferred by our team:

The states of New York, California and Illinois were among the highest for Covid related deaths, during the months of Jan thru Sep of 2020. They were also among the to 5 which had higher population of people on the move.
The overall movement of people were drastically reduced as the number of Covid deaths spiked during the month of Mar and April of 2020. However, it can also be seen that for the second (less severe) spike, during months of July and August, people did not stay put and were relatively mobile. 3.Further analysis showed that staying at home resulted in lesser covid deaths as seen in New York county 4.Another interesting insight is that the number of shorter trips reduced drastically however this trend is not observed with trips ranging over 50 miles. 5.The analysis also showed that there is no correlation between the population and deaths across USA.
